#### Writing on .txt files
```
with open("01.txt", "w", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    f.write("Hello")
```
##### *with open as f():* is used to open a .txt file. Don't need to close compared to *f = open()* and *f.close()*
##### *open("name", "type", "for Korean or other languages")*. If the file name doesn't exist, it creates a new file with the name. Type refers to whether you want to r or w. 
##### *f.write* writes a string in a single line. *f.writelines()* writes a string and ends with a \n, which means line break. 
<br/>

```
with open("C:/Users/pc/Desktop/python_projects/과제/jan6/PJT-01/data/fruits.txt", 'r') as f:
```
##### If the file is not in the same directory, an absolute or relative file address can be used. 
<br/>

```
data = f.read()

data.endswith()
```
##### to store a file in the form of a string in a variable, use f.read()
##### .endswith() gives back a boolean. Searches for a string which ends with the string in ()
<br/>

#### Using Json
<br/>

```
import json 
from pprint import pprint

movie_json = open("data/movie.json", encoding="UTF-8")
movie = json.load(movie_json)
```
##### *import json* to import internal libraries regarding json
##### *json.load(f)* to turn json objects into lists/dictionaries. *json.dumps(f)* to turn strings, lists, dictionaries into json objects. 
##### *from pprint import pprint* to use pprint().
