## **Programming language is imperative knowledge**
#### *Declarative knowledge explains what vs. Imperative knowledge explains how*
<br/>

### Variables and Objects
```
name = "phil"
```
#### *name* is a variable. *"phil"* is an object.
####  Anything written on the right is inputted as value of the left. 
<br/>

### Types of Objects
##### *type() tells us the type of the object*
<br/>

### 1. Numeric
##### Int
##### Float - *floating point rounding error*
##### Complex 
<br/>

### 2. Boolean
##### *True* or *False*
<br/>

### 3. Operators 
```
Operator + - * / % // **
In-place Operator += -= *= /= ...
Comparison Operator < > ...
Logical Operator and or not 
```
<br/>

##### *4 and 5 are Sequence Containers, which mean that they carry multiple objects. 
### 4. String 
##### Use index to access each position on the string. name[0]. 
##### Slicing s[2:5] means to include the value on index 2 until 4 and not include 5. 
##### Concatenation means you can add strings together with + 
##### Repetition means you can multiply a string with a integer to repeat the string multiple times. "hi" * 3.
##### Membership means you can get a True or False value by checking whether a letter exists in the string. 'a' in 'apple'. 
<br/>

### 5. List 
##### mylist = [] to create a list. 
##### -1 calls the index from the back. 
##### .append() adds more values to the list. 
##### .pop() deletes values from the list. 
##### len(boxes) refers to the number of objects in the list. 
##### boxes[1][0] means in object in index 1 of the list, get the letter/value on index 0. 
<br/>

### 6. None
